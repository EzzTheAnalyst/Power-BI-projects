# Power-BI-projects

In this file, you can find my projects on Power Bi, let me breakdown to you several key steps.

# 1- Data Collection and Connection

Normally I gather data from various sources like databases, Excel files, CSV files, Online Services and etc.

# 2- Data Transformation 

Once connected, the data is loaded into Power Query, where you can perform data cleaning, explore missing data & errors, fixing structure errors, manage unwanted outliers, perform operations like merging queries, pivoting or unpivoting data, creating calcuated columns to shape the data as needed, re-shape data, and ensure data the correct data types.

# 3- Data Modeling

Structuring the data by setting up relationships between tables, creating calculated columns, measures, and hierarchies. Create measures using DAX to calculate metrics, and optimize the model to ensure it is efficient by eliminating unnecessary columns, applying appropriate aggregationsm and optimizing relationships.

# 4- Data Visualization

I use Power BI's drag-and-drop interface to create visualizations such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, maps, and tables. Add slicers, filters, and buttons to make your report interactive. This allows users to explore the data by selecting different criteria, and customize the appearance of your visuals by changing colors, fonts, labels, and adding tooltips to enhance clarity and presentation.

# 5- Data Analysis and Insights

I use the visuals and measures to analyze trends, patterns, and outliers. Power BI provides tools like Quick Insights and AI visuals to help uncover deeper insights and allow users to explore data at different levels of granularity

# 6- Sharing and Collaboration

Once a report is complete, publish it to the Power BI Service (cloud) or share it within your organization.
